# MassFace: an efficient implementation for face recognition with massive identities.

## Introduction
This project provide an efficient implementation for deep face recognition using Triplet Loss. When trained on [CASIA-Webface](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/english/CASIA-WebFace-Database.html), this code can achieve an 98.3% accuracy on [LFW](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/). This repository includes:
- Samples generation
- Hard exmaples mining
- Multi-gpus implementation
- Online and semi-online training
